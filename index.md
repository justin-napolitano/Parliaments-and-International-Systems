# Parliaments and International Systems: A Technical Overview

## Motivation

This project addresses the hierarchical nature of the international system by analyzing how states compete for relative influence and authority. It focuses on the interaction between hegemonic states and sub-state actors, extending David Lake's theoretical framework to understand both international and domestic power structures. The motivation is to clarify how institutions constrain state behavior and facilitate cooperation, and how hegemonic interests shape institutional rules.

## Problem Statement

Understanding state behavior in international relations requires a framework that accounts for both the external competition among states and the internal competition among interest groups within states. Traditional models often overlook the parallel between hegemonic states in the international system and hegemonic interest groups within states. This project aims to fill that gap by conceptualizing states themselves as institutions governed by dominant internal actors.

## How It's Built

The repository contains a single text document that outlines the theoretical framework. It is a narrative synthesis rather than software or data-driven analysis. The text discusses:

- The hierarchical nature of the international system, defined by authority relations among states.
- The competition among states for top positions based on naval, martial, economic, and cultural influence.
- The role of institutions in constraining behavior and enabling cooperation.
- The analogy between hegemonic states regulating other states and hegemonic interest groups regulating sub-state actors.
- Predictive insights into state behavior based on the interests of hegemonic groups.

The document is structured as an academic essay, suitable for reference or further elaboration.

## Implementation Details

- The text references David Lake's theoretical framework, applying it both internationally and domestically.
- It emphasizes the importance of identifying hegemonic interest groups to predict state actions.
- The analysis suggests that institutional rules reflect the objectives of dominant groups, shaping both state and international behavior.
- The document is currently a raw text file without markup or formatting, indicating a foundational stage of development.

## Practical Use

For developers or analysts revisiting this project, the text serves as a conceptual foundation rather than executable code. It can be used to inform the design of simulations, models, or data analyses related to international relations and political science. Future work might involve structuring this theory into formal models or integrating it with empirical datasets.

## Summary

This project provides a concise, theoretically grounded perspective on the hierarchical international system and the interplay of hegemonic interests within states. It is a resource for those seeking to understand or model the institutional dynamics that govern state behavior and international cooperation.
