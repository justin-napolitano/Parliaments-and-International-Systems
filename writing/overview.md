I’ve built a repo called [Parliaments and International Systems](https://github.com/justin-napolitano/Parliaments-and-International-Systems). It's a dive into the complex interplay between parliamentary governments and international systems. If you're into political science or just curious about how states interact on the global stage, this is for you.

## What It's All About

At its core, this project is a text-based analysis focused on two main ideas:

1. The hierarchical nature of international systems.
2. The role that parliamentary governments play within that hierarchy.

I’m interested in understanding state behavior. Why do states act the way they do? What influences their decisions? The analysis looks at hegemonic interests, meaning the push and pull of powerful nations, and institutional constraints that influence how states cooperate or compete.

## Key Design Decisions

I chose a plain text approach for simplicity and accessibility. No frills, no complex frameworks—just raw analysis. Here’s what that means for the users:

- It's easy to access. No installation hassles. You just clone the repo and open the file in any text editor.
- It’s straightforward, allowing me to focus on the theoretical discussions without getting bogged down in coding languages or frameworks.

## Tech Stack

Not much to say here since I’m sticking with plain text:

- **Content Type**: Just text, no fancy code or tech needed.

## Getting Started

Ready to dive into the analysis? Here’s how to get started:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/Parliaments-and-International-Systems.git
   ```

2. Open the `full-txt` file with any text editor or Markdown viewer. That's it. You’re in.

## Project Structure

The project is laid out simply:

```
/ (root)
└── full-txt          # Main text file containing the analysis
```

I like keeping things clean and focused. There’s no unnecessary clutter.

## Why It Exists

I started this project because the dynamics between international systems and parliamentary governance fascinate me. As states navigate their interests, I wanted to analyze the theories behind their actions—especially how this plays out on a global scale. Understanding this can provide insights that are valuable not just for scholars but also for anyone interested in global affairs.

## Tradeoffs

While the simplicity of plain text works for easy access, there are tradeoffs:

- **Limited Formatting**: It lacks the visual appeal that comes with structured formats like Markdown or LaTeX. 
- **Static Nature**: The current single text file doesn’t allow for dynamic analysis. More interactive features could enhance understanding.

## What I'd Like to Improve Next

This is just the beginning. I have a few ideas for future work:

- **Structured Formats**: Converting the analysis into Markdown or LaTeX would not only enhance readability but also allow for better formatting of ideas.
- **Empirical Data**: Adding case studies or empirical examples could deepen the analysis and make it more relatable.
- **Visual Aids**: Diagrams or models illustrating the hierarchical international system would be helpful. I think it could clarify some concepts that are otherwise abstract in text.
- **Interactive Elements**: Eventually, I’d love to create visualizations or simulations that let users engage with the theoretical framework I've laid out.

## Stay in the Loop

If you’re interested in updates about this project, I share them on social media. You can follow me on Mastodon, Bluesky, and Twitter/X. I’d love to hear your thoughts or any ideas you might have.

In conclusion, I’m eager to expand on this initial analysis. This project is a stepping stone, and I’m looking forward to exploring the complex landscape of parliamentary governance and international relations further. Check out the repo, and let’s keep the conversation going!
