# Parliaments and International Systems

This repository contains a text-based analysis exploring the hierarchical nature of the international system and the role of parliamentary governments within it. The work investigates state behavior, hegemonic interests, and institutional constraints on cooperation and competition among states.

## Features

- Comprehensive theoretical discussion on international systems and state behavior
- Examination of hegemonic state interests and sub-state actors
- Analysis of institutional roles in shaping state and international conduct

## Tech Stack

- Plain text content (no specific programming language or framework)

## Getting Started

Since this repository primarily contains textual analysis, no installation or runtime environment is required.

## Project Structure

```
/ (root)
└── full-txt          # Main text file containing the analysis
```

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Convert text analysis into structured formats such as Markdown or LaTeX for improved readability
- Expand analysis with empirical data or case studies
- Develop supplementary materials such as diagrams or models illustrating the hierarchical international system
- Potentially build interactive visualizations or simulations based on the theoretical framework
